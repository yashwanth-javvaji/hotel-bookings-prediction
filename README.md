# Airbnb Booking Prediction
This project aims to predict customer bookings on Airbnb using machine learning techniques. By analyzing historical data and building a predictive model, we can improve revenue generation and optimize resource allocation for the company.

## Project Overview
The main objective of this project is to develop a machine learning model that accurately predicts customer bookings on Airbnb. By leveraging historical data, we can identify patterns and trends that influence booking decisions, enabling the company to make data-driven decisions to enhance revenue and improve customer satisfaction.

## Installation
- Clone the repository:
<br />```git clone https://github.com/your-username/hotel-booking-prediction.git```
- Navigate to the project directory:
<br />```cd hotel-booking-prediction```
- Install the necessary dependencies. You can install the required packages by running the following command:
<br />```pip install [package name]```

## Usage
To use the developed machine learning model for predicting Airbnb bookings, follow these steps:
- Ensure you have the required dependencies installed.
- Run the script:
<br />```python main.py```

## Data
The data used for this project is not included in this repository due to licensing restrictions. However, you can obtain the dataset from [kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/jessemostipak/hotel-booking-demand) and place it in the data/ directory.
The dataset consists of historical Airbnb booking records, including various features such as customer demographics, property details, pricing information, and booking status. It is important to preprocess and transform the data appropriately before feeding it into the model.

## Model Development
The machine learning model was developed using Python and popular libraries such as scikit-learn and pandas. The following steps were followed during model development:
- **Data preprocessing:** Handling missing values, eliminating duplicates, and transforming categorical variables.
- **Feature selection:** Identifying relevant features that significantly contribute to the prediction task.
- **Model training:** Utilizing various machine learning algorithms and techniques to train the model on the processed data.
- **Model evaluation:** Assessing the performance of the trained model using appropriate evaluation metrics.

## Results
The developed machine learning model achieved an accuracy of 85% in predicting customer bookings on Airbnb. This accuracy was measured using a holdout dataset that was not used during model training.
By accurately predicting customer bookings, the company can optimize its marketing strategies, allocate resources effectively, and enhance revenue generation. The insights gained from this project have the potential to drive significant business impact.
